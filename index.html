        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Minhtrang Nguyen and I am currently a Pre-Business Major at University of California, Riverside. I am from Orange County, California and I went to La Quinta High School in Westminster. I decided to major in Pre-Business because I have always been interested in marketing and finance. 
        I chose to go to University of California, Riverside because I fell in love with the campus when I visited it and I really like their business program. In the future I plan on concentrating in marketing. I want to major in marketing because I really enjoy interacting with people and I consider myself a people person. I also find the psychological aspect of marketing very fascinating. Also, I have always been outgoing and expressive, so I believe that a career in marketing would suit my personality the best.
        I also really enjoy film and would love to incorporate my passion for film into a future career in marketing. I would love to make videos advertising for products. In addition, I have experience with finance in the past, and I am also interested in this field. However, I am also open to learning more about other fields of business. <br><br>

        My professional experience includes working at Blaze Pizza as a Team Member, Wendy's, and Rollin' Creamery. Therefore, I have a lot experience with customer service and handling food. In addition, I held many board positions when I attended La Quinta High School.
        For example, I was the treasurer for my entire class during my Freshman and Senior year. These positions introduced me to finance and sparked my interest in this field. I handled all of the money for my class and raised money for events such as prom and graduation by hosting and booking many fundraisers. In addition, I was the Activities Commissioner for my school's Associated Student Body.
        We were in charge of planning lunch time activities and spirit weeks. I also acted as a liaison between the student body and the school administration. This improved my communication skills as I was able to interact with people of higher position. Finally, I was also the captain of my tennis team. 
        This position taught me a lot about leadership. I needed to set a good example for my team, and motivate them to put their all into each and every game. <br><br>

        I would describe myself as an extremely hard-working, driven, and passionate person. I always strive to put my all into everything that I do. One of my strengths is that I am outgoing and I am not afraid to be myself around others. I love making other people laugh and I want people to feel comfortable around me.
        In addition, with all my experience holding treasurer positions and being in the Associated Student Body of my school, my communication skills have improved immensely and are also one of my strengths. In addition, holding job positions at establishments such as Blaze Pizza, improved my ability to work with others and improved my interaction with customers.
